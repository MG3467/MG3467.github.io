        <h3>What makes a John Cena?</h3>
        <p>A John Cena is someone that we look up to. John Cena embody what we truly value most. Therefore the John's we select as role models says a lot about who we are as people.</p>
        <p>John Cena is a very popular pro wrestler who is imfamously invisible. This gives him a major edge in the arena because nobody sees him but his floating armbands. However, this doesn't mean that he is always invisble. John can toggle his invisblity so people can actually see him in day to day life. It's amazing! </p>
