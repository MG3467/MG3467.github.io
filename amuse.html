        <h1>Things that are too funny</h1>
        <p>These are things that I have found the internet and found pretty humorious</p>

        <h2>A classic</h2>
        <p>This right here was the gold mine of the 2010s, Nugget, biscuit, then a Nugget in a biscuit! Crazy idea for the time I guess but it still pretty good. Although the guy made the video definitely went off the deep end.

        <h2>The humble zerg army</h2>
        <p>In recent times I have become more and more fond a RTS game named Starcraft 2, but this after years of neglect and of it simmering in the back of my mind. However, I recently came across this video that killed me,<em>a bug for the bugs if you will.</em>

        <h2>An interesting video for sure</h2>
        <p>This video is not a true representation of all of these types of flims made with SFM or Source film maker, because I could name a ton of those that have amused me, but rather I will use this as a tribute to all of the SFM movies that have made me laught and got a good chuckle out.
