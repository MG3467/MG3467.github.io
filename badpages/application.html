                        <p> This website is used for learning C++ online for free. It is maintainted by a soild community, keeping up to date on current C++ Knowledge. This website is great to learn from because it is very good with solid information and great tips. I personally like how the material is covered within this online book.</p>

                    <li> <h3>What is C++?</h3>
                        <p>C++ is a higher level programming language...in the 1980s, now it is considered a lower level programming language that basically talks to the instruction set. C++ actually, as the name inplies, was the not the first C language.</p>

                        <p>C which came out in 1972 and refined in 1989 by ANSI, that same time C++ came out. C++ is considered a superset of C, which means that it has everything that C has plus more. This more is mainly higher level coding ideas, class, polymorphism, and other very important ideas.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><h3>Why use C++?</h3>
                        <p>Being a superset of C means that it has all of the advantages of C without the disadvantages of C. C++ is very fast with the built in memory functions for even faster operations.</p> 

                    </li>
                    <li><h3>Drawbacks</h3>
                        <p>C++ is very old, like very old, and it's ages shows a lot in it's syntax and other things. I don't think that it should be used as a replacement to every programming language because it definitely has it's niche, but it does it very well.</p>
